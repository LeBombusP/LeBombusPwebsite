# LeBombusP Website
My simple websirte made with React then ported to Svelte then remade in React (again) and then remade again in SvelteKit.
*I've had enough*

## Old branches are avalible but i don't recommend looking at that code, it's a mess.
Current branch is even more of a mess but it's still better than the old ones (if that makes sense).

## How to run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Go to `127.0.0.1:5173`

### Current branch is far from production ready
But i will deploy it soon anyway.
